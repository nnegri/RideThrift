#Ride Thrift

Ride Thrift provides price comparisons for rideshare apps, using the Uber and Lyft APIs to retrieve on the minute estimates for a route chosen by the user. Google Maps and Places APIs provide autocomplete and geolocation functionality, as well as a route map. Users have the option to save and delete addresses in their account, which are stored in the database. Users may request rides from their own accounts through OAuth, and the status of the trip is dynamically updated via AJAX.  C3.js, a D3-based library, is utilized for data visualization of historical surge/primetime rates for any given day and time. Data on surge pricing was collected via automated API requests running over the course of a week.

Once the request is completed, a status message is updated throughout the trip:

```

Install the dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Sign up to use the [Uber API](https://developer.uber.com/docs/rides/getting-started), the [Lyft API](https://www.lyft.com/developers), and the [Google Places API](https://developers.google.com/places/javascript/).

Save your API keys in a file called <kbd>secrets.sh</kbd> using this format:

```
export UBER_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
export UBER_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
export UBER_SERVER_TOKEN="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
export LYFT_CLIENT_ID="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
export LYFT_CLIENT_SECRET="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
```

Source your keys from your secrets.sh file into your virtual environment:

```
source secrets.sh
```

Set up the database:

```
python model.py
python seed.py
psql estimates < estimates.sql
```

Run the app:

```
python server.py
```

You can now navigate to 'localhost:5000/' to access Ride Thrift.
